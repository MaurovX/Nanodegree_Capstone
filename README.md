 ## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
 
 As a part of the Data Science Nanodegree in Udacity, we are required to develop a final project using public/given relevant data, I decided to use the GiveMeSomeCredit dataset given my current role in the organization financing my studies. The results of this project are summarized on the file Capstone_project.html

The full set of files related to this repo are public and free of use. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the project, the first notebook Credit_EDA is an EDA of the dataset, we seek to understand the dataset and to plot our insights. After that the Second notebook aims at answering the main question, how to implement explanations at the correct level of granularity. Capstone_Project.
